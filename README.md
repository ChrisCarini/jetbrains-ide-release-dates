# JetBrains IDE Release Dates

## Description
The intent of this repository is to capture the actual release dates for JetBrains IDEs.
The concept stems from a wiki page at work which was created to help our team plan work around the potential release dates of JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA.

_**Why** did our team care?_ Well, we develop and maintain an ecosystem around JetBrains (from internal-only plugin distribution, to license management, to a custom distributed IntelliJ IDE). Knowing when a release might come allows us to better plan our week / month / year to enable our developers to be as productive as possible! 

Very simply, the idea here is to allow one to more accurately predict (we used to just guess months out - turns out, that's very inaccurate) about when a particular IntelliJ IDEA release ***may*** occur based on historical data.
