# JetBrains IDE Release Dates

## Description
The intent of this repository is to capture the actual release dates for JetBrains IDEs.
The concept stems from a wiki page at work which was created to help our team plan work around the potential release dates of JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA.

The idea here is to allow one to more accurately predict (we used to just guess months out - turns out, that's very inaccurate) about when a particular IntelliJ IDEA release ***may*** occur based on historical data.

## JetBrains IDEs
- [IntelliJ IDEA](ides/IntelliJ_IDEA_Release_Dates.md)

## Obtaining Release Dates
Below is the methodology for obtaining the release dates along with examples (for IntelliJ IDEA) for each step. Follow the steps, in order, and stop at the first date that's been identified using the process below:
1) **Check the [JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA Download Page](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/), and use the `Released` date noted there**
2) **Check the [JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA Previous Releases Page](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/previous.html), and use the `Released` date noted there**
3) **Check the [JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA Blog - Releases Category Page](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/category/releases/), and use the `Posted` date noted by the respective blog post**

4) **Check the JetBrains Confluence Page for the respective IntelliJ IDEA Release Notes version**
